        <h1>Abilities</h1><br>
        <p>
          In my personal projects I have used some programming languages,
          as much in front-end as in the backend, however, my strong one and
          my more developed abilities are in the part front, some of the
          projects are built in front end:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>html</li>
          <li>css</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
          <li>C++</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          And I have used frameworks like: Vue.js, JQuery, Bootstrap.
          In the part back of some of my projects have used:
        </p>
          <ul>
            <li>php</li>
            <li>SQL</li>
            <li>Java</li>
          </ul>
        <p>
          However, I am willing to fasten other languages, framworks,
          and development tools to go being formed little by little in a full stack.

        <p>
       The studies that I have carried out have been a great support in my academic
       formation, but they have also been formed in my personal formation, although
       every day my self taught formation is the one that reinforces my knowledge.
       I have studies carried out in:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Technique in Systems (SENA)</li>
          <li>Technologist in systems University of Caldas (Universidad de Caldas)</li>
          <li>It programs I develop front-end (Prospercity)</li>
