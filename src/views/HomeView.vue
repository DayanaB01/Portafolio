        <p>
          I have abilities in different programming languages, something of python, c++ and java,
          I have basic knowledge of backend, although my strong and favorite is development
          front-end, my projects are emphasized in the html part, css and Javascript, handling
          some framworks like Vue, boostsrap, jquery, css pre-compiler like scss and some
          projects have carried out them with content agents as joomla and wordpress. I want
          to continue learning and to strengthen my learning abilities and at the same time
          to help in a development team in a managerial project  and to share the abilities that
          I have acquired until today.
